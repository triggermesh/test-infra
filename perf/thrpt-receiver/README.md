# thrpt-receiver

A simple CloudEvent receiver that can measure the throughput of the events it receives and send results to a [Mako stub
sidecar][mako-stub].

```none
Usage of thrpt-receiver:
  -consecutive-quiet-periods uint
        Consecutive recheck-period after which data is aggregated if no new event has been recorded. (default 2)
  -estimated-total-events uint
        Estimated total number of events to receive. Used to pre-allocate memory. (default 100)
  -profiling
        Periodically publish the length of the receive queue to Mako and enable a pprof server on port 8008.
  -recheck-period duration
        Frequency at which the recording of new events is being checked. (default 5s)
```

## Running the receiver in a cluster

### Deployment

Deploy the receiver and its dependencies into the `perf-thrpt-receiver` namespace using `ko`:

```console
$ ko apply -f config/
```

The receiver will be waiting for the first event to be received:

```console
$ kubectl -n perf-thrpt-receiver logs thrpt-receiver receiver
2020/10/30 16:17:03 Running event recorder
2020/10/30 16:17:03 Running CloudEvents handler
2020/10/30 16:17:03 Waiting for the first event to be received
```

### Sending events

Configure an event source to send events to the `perf-thrpt-receiver/thrpt-receiver` Service, for example using a sink
reference:

```yaml
sink:
  ref:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    name: thrpt-receiver
    namespace: perf-thrpt-receiver
```

After the first event has been received, the receiver keeps processing events and checks every `-recheck-period` that
events are still being received. If no event is received for a number of periods corresponding to
`-consecutive-quiet-periods`, the receiver stops its event handler and publishes the benchmark's results to its Mako
sidecar:

```console
$ kubectl -n perf-thrpt-receiver logs thrpt-receiver receiver
...
2020/10/30 16:28:05 Event received, waiting until no more event is being recorded for 2 consecutive periods of 5s
2020/10/30 16:30:30 Observed 1 period(s) without event
2020/10/30 16:30:35 Observed 2 period(s) without event
2020/10/30 16:30:35 Stopping event recorder and CloudEvents handler
2020/10/30 16:30:35 Received events count: 1000
2020/10/30 16:30:35 Processing data
2020/10/30 16:30:35 Publishing results to Mako
```

### Reading results

The results, presented in a CSV format, can be exported from a HTTP endpoint served by the Mako sidecar on port `8081`.

Forward the local TCP port `8081` to the `thrpt-receiver` Pod:

```console
$ kubectl -n perf-thrpt-receiver port-forward thrpt-receiver 8081
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8081 -> 8081
```

Retrieve the results over HTTP at the `/results` endpoint and write the output to a file named `results.csv`:

```console
$ curl http://localhost:8081/results -o results.csv
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 6771k    0 6771k    0     0  5976k      0 --:--:--  0:00:01 --:--:-- 5976k
```

The contents of the `results.csv` file should be similar to the example below:

```csv
# Received input
# Input completed
# Benchmark  - Event throughput
# {"benchmarkKey":"","tags":["nodes=6","project-id=cebuk-01","zone=us-central1-a","commit=f584d79","kubernetes=v1.17.12-gke.500","goversion=go1.15.2"]}
# inputValue,errorMessage,rt
...
1.605030612296653e+12,,746
1.605030612298227e+12,,747
1.6050306122983225e+12,,748
1.6050306122986868e+12,,749
1.6050306122990955e+12,,750
1.605030612299801e+12,,751
1.605030612300778e+12,,752
1.60503061230106e+12,,753
...
# CSV end
```

See the [Plotting](#plotting) section below for suggestions about exploiting those results.

Send a final HTTP request to the `/close` endpoint to allow the Mako sidecar to terminate:

```console
$ curl -s http://localhost:8081/close
```

### Clean up

By default, the receiver Pod is requesting the resources of an entire cluster node, which makes it expensive to run. It
is therefore a good practice to clean up the receiver's resources at the end of the benchmark:

```console
$ ko delete -f config/
```

## Plotting

The results published by `thrpt-receiver` can be visualized by generating plots from CSV data. A few different ways to
create such visualizations are described in this section.

### Google Sheets

1. Open a Sheet, then select **File > Import > Upload** to upload the CSV file generated from the logs of the Mako
   sidecar.

   ![Import CSV](.assets/plot-gsheets-import-csv.png)

1. _(optional)_ Delete the unnecessary comment rows 1-3 and B column (`errorMessage`) by highlighting them, then
   selecting **Edit > Delete rows/column ...**.

1. _(optional)_ Create a column containing human-friendly timestamps.

   Highlight the A column (`inputValue`), then select **Insert > Column right**. Select the B2 cell, and use the
   following [formula][gsheets-ts-formula] in the formula bar: `=A2/1000/60/60/24 + DATE(1970,1,1)`.

   Format the cell as a Time by selecting **Format > Number > Time**, then apply that format and formula to the entire
   column, either with `Ctrl-C` (highlight all cells with `Ctrl-Shift-â†“`) `Ctrl-V`, or by using the [Fill
   Handle][gsheets-fill].

   ![Format time cell](.assets/plot-gsheets-format-datetime.png)

1. Highlight the entire time:value data range, then select **Insert > Chart**.

1. Edit the chart's options and select the _Line chart_ type. You may also need to manually set the `time` column as the
   X-axis.

   ![Chart values](.assets/plot-gsheets-line-chart.png)

1. You can improve the visualization of the chart by moving it to its own sheet. This can be achieved by selecting
   **Move to own sheet** in the menu accessible in the top-right corner of the chart.
